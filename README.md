# Fitzwilliam Museum Repository Holding Page

This is a very simple repository containing a single HTML page with full page background of the Fitzwilliam Museum portico. It's purpose is very simple! It is used as a landing page to prevent a "dangling DNS" record being used for a subdomain takeover, which happened to us. For a good explanation of this, Microsoft have created an [accessible explanation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/subdomain-takeover) relating to Azure, but the principles remain the same. Subdomain security is an interesting area and conference papers now discuss this regularly eg [Can I Take Your Subdomain? Exploring Same-Site Attacks in the Modern Web](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-squarcina.pdf).

To explain, our DNS set up at the Fitzwilliam Museum uses chained CNAMEs (not always considered best practise) to enable us to subdomain our static websites using Github pages (see [RFC 1034 - Domain names - concepts and facilities](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034.html#section-3.6.2) . We have a master CNAME: [github.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk](https://github.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk) and then subsequent CNAMEs which chain off this eg [data-islands.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk](https://data-islands.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/). 

Due to an oversight, we forgot to create a repository that linked to the master CNAME used for static page websites, and this domain was snaffled by a random, malicious developer who created an illicit downloaded PDF farm using that domain name. This was discovered by our search engine spider, which started to index a bunch of random PDFs on our domain. To get the domain back takes a bit of liaison with Github by raising tickets, and setting up [text record authentication on your DNS](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages) for your domains. So if this happens to you via Github Pages, raise a ticket with their support team and then follow the steps they ask you to complete, verify your domain and then mitigate for any reputational damage that might occur.
